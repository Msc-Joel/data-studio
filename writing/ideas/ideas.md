# Generating Ideas

## What made you think?

Any time you're curious about or surprised by something, **make a note of it.** There's a good chance each one is a story.

!!! example

    I was intrigued by a [Twitter battle about male and female trees](https://twitter.com/SarahTaber_bww/status/1423016010131648513) and [explored the topic with data](https://jsoma.github.io/trees/).

## Change the geography

Take a story that was published on a national level and reproduce it at a state or county level, or attempt the same analysis for a different country. Alternatively, find a story done in a smaller or local paper and spin it into something larger.

!!! example

    I took a [national map of single people](https://jonathansoma.com/singles/) and [zoomed in on NYC](http://visualizing.nyc/nyc-zip-codes-singles-map/).

## Update an older story

If a story came out five or ten years ago, things might have changed since then. Or not! Either one can typically be a story.

!!! example

    Back in 2017 OpenNews published [the results of data journalism salary survey](https://medium.com/jsk-class-of-2018/news-nerd-salaries-2017-2c83466b994e), which would certainly be worth revisiting to see how things have changed.


## Compare groups

Many times the rows of your dataset can be put into groups, and then the groups can be compared. This is possible if your rows have some sort of category that shows up multiple times.

!!! example

    * If you have crimes in various cities, you can count the crimes in each city
    * If you have people with job titles, you can calculate median salary for each job title
    * If you have power plants with energy sources, you can sum the total CO2 produced by each energy source
