# Data Studio: How to Make Stuff!

Working with and presenting data isn't about going through a nice orderly to-do list of things to learn, it's just about *making stuff*. Every new project will require you to stretch and learn a new skill or two. This site tells you what to learn, and how to learn it.

You ask about how to do something, I tell you how to do it (or provide links).
